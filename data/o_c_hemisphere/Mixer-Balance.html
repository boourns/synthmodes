    <div class="content"><p>Mixer:Balance is a two-input CV mixer with a balance control and two complementary outputs.</p>

<h2>Controls</h2>

<ul>
<li>Inputs: CV 1 and CV 2 are the input signals</li>
<li>Outputs: Complementary mixed outputs</li>
<li>Encoder: Determines the balance between CV 1 and CV 2</li>
</ul>

<p>The balance indicator, controlled by the encoder, shows the relationship between the CV 1 and CV 2 signals&#39; relative levels at Output A/C. With the indicator all the way to the left, only CV 1&#39;s signal appears at A/C; all the way to the right, only CV 2&#39;s signal appears at A/C.</p>

<p>Output B/D is the complement of A/C. That is, the relative levels of CV 1 and CV 2 are the opposite, so that with the balance indicator at the left, only CV 2&#39;s signal appears at B/D, etc.</p>

<p>In Mixer:Balance, all signals are attenuated by 50% before being sent to the mix.</p>
